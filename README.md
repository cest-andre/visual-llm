Project for MATS Winter 24-25 Neel/Arthur Stream.

Code performs the following:

1) Makes Llava Mistral and Mistral-IT-v0.2 compatible with TransformerLens.
2) Trains sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for both models using SAELens.
3) Creates feature dashboards of those SAEs using SAEDashboard.
4) Generates automated explanations and interpretability scores using automated-interpretability (lifted code from neuronpedia_intergration.py in SAELens).
5) Generates feature visualization images for Llava neurons and SAE features using Lucent.
6) Analyzes data and generates plots.
